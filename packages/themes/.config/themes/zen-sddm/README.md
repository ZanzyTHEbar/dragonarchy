# SDDM theme mapping

This directory intentionally documents SDDM themes shipped via `packages/sddm`.

SDDM themes are not switched by the regular theme manager's `theme-set`; instead, use:

```
scripts/theme-manager/sddm-menu
scripts/theme-manager/sddm-set <theme>
scripts/theme-manager/refresh-sddm
```
