# Dragon workstation AMDGPU configuration (opt-in)
#
# Keep this file conservative: module parameters here affect boot graphics.
# If you need aggressive overclocking / powerplay features, prefer documenting
# the required settings and enabling them intentionally.
#
# Examples (COMMENTED OUT by default):
#
# Enable additional powerplay / overdrive features (advanced; can be risky):
# options amdgpu ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff
#
# Force Display Core on (usually default on modern GPUs):
# options amdgpu dc=1
